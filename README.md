Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. 
A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. 
It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.
Facial recognition can help verify a person’s identity for a visual attendance or security system.
The face recognition module has accuracy up to 99.38% .

In the field of Real time Face Recognition, the most important beginning is the labeled data set of images. This step is actually responsible for both trainingand testing of our built model.

We have to deal with the problem that faces turned different directions look totally different to a computer.
To do this, we are going to use an algorithm called face landmark estimation. he basic idea is we will come up with 68 specific points (called landmarks) that exist on every face — the top of the chin, the outside edge of each eye, the inner edge of each eyebrow, etc. Then we will train a machine-learning algorithm to be able to find these 68 specific points on any face.

This last step is actually the easiest step in the whole process. All we have to do is find the person in our database of known people who has the closest measurements to our test image. Classification of images is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVMs).
